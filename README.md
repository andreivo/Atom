# Atom SysVAP

## 1.	Introduction
Atom SysVAP is a tool for development and simulation of finite automata. The name "Atom" is an allusion to the atom, due to the appearance that an automaton can gain in a state diagram. The SysVAP surname is an acronym for "System for Validation of finite Automatons and Execution Plans".

The tool is suitable for learning formal languages and allows integration with other systems through a JAVA library. This integration can be useful in systems that have deliberative skills, to evaluate the actions that will be performed, functioning as a security system.

Atom SysVAP allows representation in Mealy and Moore state machines, in addition to StatesCharts.

## 3.	About the source code

The tool is a desktop application and was developed using Java Swing.
At that time, Netbeans IDE 7.0.1 and the Java 6 SDK were used.
